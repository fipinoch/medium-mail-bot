This repository is part of a [Medium article](https://medium.com/me/stats/post/18747f65cec8) I wrote. It basically explains how to send a simple email through the SMT protocol with Python using a simple Gmail account.

In order to make the script `main.py` work an `.env` using the template `example.env` file as template. The file `main.py` already comes ready to be used in Google Cloud by having the function parameters `data` and `context` already coded, but if needed to ran locally those parameters can be removed.

For more information on how to setup the mail account, how the script works and how to leave it running on GCP you can read the article.
